### Parts of the Repository

1. **Encryption Algorithms** - consists of the different algorithms we have utilised.
2. **Key Storage Techniques** - consists of the different Kernel Level key storage techniques we have used.
3. **eunomia-bpf-file-redirection** (Version 1) - File encryption implementation using eunomia-bpf.
4. **eunomia-bpf-file-redirection** (Version 2) - File redirection using filename encryption using eunomia-bpf.
5. **opensnoop-replica** (Version 3) - A close copy of the BCC tool opensnoop to encrypt and redirect files in user space by tracing syscalls at kernel level.
6. **file-encryption-ldpreload** (Version 4) - Generation of a shared object which can be dynamically linked to trace syscalls and perform encryption, decryption and redirection of files.
